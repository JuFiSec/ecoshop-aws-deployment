# CRITICAL ANALYSIS

### Security

[cite_start]The infrastructure adheres to basic best practices (private subnets for sensitive servers, segmented security groups). However, further improvements can be made:

* [cite_start]Adding AWS WAF in front of the Load Balancer would help block common web attacks (e.g., SQLI, XSS).
* [cite_start]Secrets Manager would be preferable for managing passwords, especially database credentials, instead of hardcoding them.
* [cite_start]Activating CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs would enhance visibility and auditability of actions performed in the environment.

### High Availability

* [cite_start]Using an Auto Scaling Group would automate the addition or removal of EC2 instances based on load.
* [cite_start]For RDS, the Multi-AZ option has been enabled, which is a good point. [cite_start]However, one or more read replicas could be added to optimize read operations.

### Performance and Cost

Several optimizations are possible:

* [cite_start]Replacing some instances with Spot Instances for development or testing environments.
* [cite_start]Migrating EBS storage from GP2 to GP3 would save up to 20% without performance loss.
* [cite_start]Implementing CloudFront as a CDN for static files would reduce latency for end-users.

### Additional Recommendations

* [cite_start]Encryption of data at rest and in transit.
* [cite_start]Disabling root SSH login.
* [cite_start]Implementing HTTPS security headers on the application.
